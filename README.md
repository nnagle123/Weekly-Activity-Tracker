# Weekly Activity Tracker

This is a browser-based weekly activity tracker built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows users to track weekly activity goals, visualize progress with a simple chart, and store the data locally in the browser.

This activity tracker was inspired by Ben Oosterveld's Weekly Activity Tracker, taught in his Sales To Scale course.
